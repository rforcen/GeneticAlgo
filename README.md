# GeneticAlgo
Genetic Algorithm to draw refrence image with a limited set of circles
uses xcode and metal to boost performance using gpu kernel shader, in a low end gpu (gt 740) a complete artion is done in about 300ms
it's based on https://github.com/Sampanna-Sharma/genetic-algorithm-image-evolution?files=1 (python) work but with performance improvement in mind, in python a typical generation takes 5 secs.
